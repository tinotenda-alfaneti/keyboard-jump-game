One of the proudest accomplishments of my life was earning my college degree, despite the fact that my early adulthood pointed in the opposite direction, beginning with my marriage at the age of 19. Throughout the 1990s I lived as one of the "working poor," someone who slipped through the cracks of supposedly historic prosperity. By the age of 25 I was divorced and frustrated with menial, low-paying jobs: clerk, receptionist, and housecleaner. There is nothing like scrubbing someone else's toilet to inspire one with determination toward obtaining an education. Because of my absolute commitment toward earning my degree, I got a flexible shift at a retail warehouse which enabled me to acquire my degree while supporting myself financially. Enrolled at the local community college, I experienced a different world opening up to me; excited by a new encouraging environment, I excelled academically. I learned that if I tried hard, I could succeed; if I wanted something badly enough, I possessed the ability to take advantage of these opportunities. I worked a minimum 35-hour workweek for five years to put myself through school without succumbing to the temptation of a student loan. I paid tuition up front with the money I earned. It was the example of my mother, a Puerto Rican immigrant working diligently to provide for her family, who instilled a work ethic into me that has stood me in good stead. With a lifelong passion for history, I have developed an interest in the cultural history of early modern and modern Europeans, especially women's history. The experiences of ordinary women fascinate me: how they constitute their world through popular folk tales and literature; how the seemingly irrational paradoxes of the past to modern eyes are completely rational when taken within the historical context; and finally, how these historical changes and transformations in culture constitute the present. I enjoy studying the early modern period of English history, especially the Tudor- Stuart period, because of the tensions that existed between medieval philosophies and the rising Enlightenment intellectualism.I waited patiently by the bench in what all Harvey Mudd chemistry majors call the "Super Lab," staring for what seemed to be
hours at a small flask bubbling with something that looked like a cross between Pepto-Bismol and whipped cream. I was
waiting for the color to turn just the right shade of blue before I could go home for a late dinner, but it was obvious that this
solution was as far from blue as baseball is from rugby. I realized then that "Super Lab" was not so Super, and neither was a
career as a chemist.
Every summer since high school, I worked at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory as a research assistant. One of my major projects
involved working on a team to develop probes for the detection radioactive substances. When I turned in my final report, a
computer program that would give the same results in five minutes four people would in a week, my pride turned into
disappointment when my supervisor took credit for all of my hard work. Unbeknownst to me, somewhere in tiny print in the
contract signed as an employee; it said something to the effect that as an employee I would relinquish all rights to everything
that I developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. I felt that it was unfair for a company to claim such rights to its
employees' innovations and wished to learn more about the issues that surround intellectual property.
I was introduced to the field of intellectual property law in industrial chemistry, taught by Professor Gerald Van Hecke. For m
final report, I researched the development of the Gore-Tex fiber b procuring its patent from an online patent service. At that
time, was considering a career in the management sector of the chemical industry because I wanted to be able to use my
knowledge of applied chemistry while at the same time work with people. However, once I was introduced to industrial
chemistry law, I realized that a career in law would not only incorporate all of my skills but would give me more breadth than
(OVER)
management in a chemical company. Whereas management would limit me to a particular industry, IP law would expose me to
a number of industries. IP law would also not confine me to a particular strategy in dealing with problems but force me to
develop different strategies based on the industry and the problem that I am dealing with. Law school suddenly became a very
attractive career path to me, especially because it would allow me to use my education creatively to help protect the product of
peoples' ideas.
Although I am an applied chemistry major, what I have learned as an undergraduate can be applied in many ways to law.
Because I have a strong technical background, I have been trained extensively in solving problems both alone and in teams.
Although the problems themselves have been technical, the analytical skills that I have acquired in solving such problems can
be applied to the world of law. Harvey Mudd's unique engineering clinic program allowed me to work on a team of five
students to develop a project plan for General Electric Nuclear Energy to bring the concentration of toxic organic compounds in
their waste system down to environmentally safe levels. I have also worked on student teams to solve problems for Habitat for
Humanity, and during my summer internships to solve problems for the government. Because I am an applicant from a
nontraditional background, I can provide a different perspective to problems encountered in law, and can even introduce vastly
different but equally effective approaches to solving these problems.
My technical background is not the only factor that sets me apart from the traditional law school applicant. Because Harvey
Mudd balances its technical program with an equally strong emphasis in the humanities, I am not only leaving Mudd with a
great education in chemistry but I am leaving Mudd as a technically educated student who is skilled in writing and
communication. In addition to possessing a liberal arts background that is unequaled by most technical applicants to law school,
I also possess a back-ground that is unique even for a Harvey Mudder. The typical Harvey Mudd student studies at Mudd for
four years, then pursues graduate school in a science or engineering field, and then works in either industry or academia. Unlike
the typical Mudd student, I have managed not only to perform well academically, but to take advantage of nonacademic
opportunities in order to better balance my life. My experience as the resident assistant of my dorm has given me tools that are
necessary to a lawyer such as time management, interpersonal and conflict resolution skills, as well as the ability to effectively
deal with crisis situations. Having to juggle my responsibilities as a resident assistant, a student, and an athlete has increased my
organizational skills by orders of magnitude. As freshman and sophomore class president, and team leader of an engineering
project, I learned how to be more assertive and gained valuable leadership skills in the process. In addition, my membership the
National Forensics League and participation in Lincoln-Douglas debates have provided me with the skills of impromptu speech,
or communication, and the art of persuasion using sound facts as the basis for arguments.
I finally managed to completely break the mold of the typical Harvey Mudd student by attempting to study abroad for one
semester. This was the greatest challenge of my undergraduate career because not many science and engineering majors, let
alone Harvey Mudd students, leave to study at foreign institutions. Many attribute this to the specificity of the science
curriculum and the resulting difficulty in finding compatible curricula at foreign institutions. After making use of all the
resources possible, I realize that although it is indeed an arduous task to find a university abroad that matches our curriculum to
a tee, it is not impossible to do so. After one year of persuading some reluctant administrators to make it easier for a Harvey
Mudd student to leave for one semester, I found myself at the University of New South Wales in Australia where I had some of
the most valuable experiences in my life. I returned much more independent, and especially aware of the world around me.
Upon my return, and due in part to my own example, I discovered that the school had proposed many changes to allow more
flexibility in the students' education so that studying abroad would be possible for others who follow me.
I once had the misperception that those who are educated in disciplines such as political science, public policy, or pre-law are
more likely to be prepared for a graduate education in law than most other students. Now I believe that a student coming from a
more nontraditional background can contribute in many ways to society as a lawyer. In a world where technology is the
dominant means of progress and is advancing at such a breakneck pace, it can be a great advantage to society to have
knowledgeable people working with laws concerning technology. I not only believe that I am qualified to perform this service
to society as a lawyer, but I am convinced that [school withheld] possesses the quality of education and diversity in student
body that can best help me fulfill these goals.
